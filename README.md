**Description:**  
A collection of **problems and solutions** in Data Structures & Algorithms, solved across multiple platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder, CSES, HackerRank, etc.).  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build a reusable **library of patterns** (two-pointers, sliding window, binary search, BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, DP, greedy, etc.)
- Keep **solutions minimal but readable**, with quick complexity notes
- Track progress across platforms in a single place
